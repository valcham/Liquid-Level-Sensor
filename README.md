# Liquid-Level-Sensor
Program for calibrating the liquid level sensor. Converts analog values to inch values. 
Deterimine activation threshold for sensor in both analog and inch values. 
Edit calibration equation to improve accuracy. Use info page to find fit equation.
Edit viscosity value to tune moving average. 

# Liquid-Level-Control
Program for controlling liquid level pump using liquid level sensor.  
Copy any changes from liquid-level-sensor program to control program.
Currently set up for single speed and direction control.
Can be modified to account for variable speed and direction.
